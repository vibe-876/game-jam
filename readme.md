# Tax Evasion
have you ever wanted to play a game about tax evasion? Well now you can (and by now, I mean once this game is finished...)!

You can live out all of your tax evading fantasies, all from the comfort of your computer's terminal (very comfy).

## Documentation
All documentation can be found [here](./docs.md).

We also have something of a plan, which is [here](.game_notes.md).

## Building & Running
Very simple, just enter your shell and run make with no arguments, which, compiles it, and then run the binary; the binary will be called "tax\_evasion\_over\_telnet". If you want something else, just edit the "COUT" variable in the makefile.

You'll need to have:
- gcc
- make
- glibc (you could you something else, but we haven't tested it)
- ncurses
